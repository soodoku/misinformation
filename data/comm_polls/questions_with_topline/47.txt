Kaiser Health Tracking Poll [January, 2015]

I'm going to read you a list of specific elements or parts of the law. For each, please tell me whether you think it is something the law does, or not. To the best of your knowledge, would you say the (2010) health reform law does or does not...provide financial help to low and moderate income Americans who don't get insurance through their jobs to help them purchase coverage?

63%	Yes, law does this
30%	No, law does not do this
6%	Don't know/Refused
