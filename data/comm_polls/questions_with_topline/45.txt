Kaiser Health Tracking Poll [March, 2015]

I'm going to read you a list of specific elements or parts of the law. For each, please tell me whether you think it is something the law does, or not. To the best of your knowledge, would you say the (2010) health reform law does or does not...require nearly all Americans to have health insurance or else pay a fine?

81%	Yes, law does this
14%	No, law does not do this
5%	Don't know/Refused
