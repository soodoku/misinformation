PEW RESEARCH CENTER FOR THE PEOPLE & THE PRESS
MARCH 2008 POLITICAL SURVEY
N=1,503

This survey was conducted March 19-22, 2008. The field period was one day shorter than usual
to avoid conducting interviews on Easter Sunday.

Because of a programming error, some Form 2 respondents did not get questions 23 and 24 on the first
night of interviewing. Those cases are coded 99. PSRA re-called respondents to ask these questions,
but the N for these questions (1,217) is a little lower than for other questions asked of all 
registered voters (1,248).
