Survey by Associated Press
Methodology: Conducted by GfK Knowledge Networks March 20-March 24, 2014, and based on telephone interviews with a national adult sample of 1,012. The poll was fielded by GfK Knowledge Networks using its national KnowledgePanel.  The KnowledgePanel is a nationally representative probability sample of the U.S. adult population. Panelists are recruited by randomly selecting residential addresses using a process called address-based sampling (ABS). Since nearly 3-in-10 U.S. households do not have home Internet access, respondent households who do not have Internet access or own a computer are provided Internet service and a netbook computer to ensure that panel respondents are representative of the U.S. adult population. Unlike opt-in panels, households are not permitted to "self-select" into KnowledgePanel; nor are they allowed to participate in many surveys per week. [USAP.042114G.R01F]
