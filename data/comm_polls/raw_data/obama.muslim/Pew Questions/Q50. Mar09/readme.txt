PEW RESEARCH CENTER FOR THE PEOPLE & THE PRESS
March 2009 POLITICAL SURVEY
March 9-12, 2009
N=1,308


This dataset includes cell phone interviews conducted using an RDD sample of cell phone numbers. 
Cell phone interviews include households that are cell-only as well as those that also have a landline phone. 
The dataset contains three weight variables. 

WEIGHT is the weight for the combined sample of all landline and cell phone interviews. 
Data for all Pew Research Center reports are analyzed using this weight.

The other two weights can be used to compared the combined sample with the landline sample by itself 
and with the landline sample combined with the cell-only households.

LLWEIGHT is for analysis of the landline RDD sample only. Interviews conducted by cellphone are not 
given a weight and are excluded from analysis when this weight is used.

COWEIGHT is for analysis of the combined landline RDD sample and the cell-only cases. 
Cases from the cell phone RDD sample that reported having a landline phone are not given 
a weight and are excluded from analysis when this weight is used.

Beginning in the Fall of 2008, the Pew Research Center started using respondents’ self-reported zip code as  
the basis for geographic variables such as region, state and county. We do this because the error rate in the original 
geographic information associated with the sample is quite high, especially for respondents from the cell phone sample. 

For respondents who do not provide a zip code or for those we cannot match, we use the sample geographic information. 
We continue to include the original sample geographic variables in the datasets (these variables are preceded by an ‘s’) 
for archival purposes only.

NOTE: The results of Q.24a-h are not included in the dataset and were not reported because the trends to previous Pew surveys 
are not comparable due to differences in the question context.

HISP1 and HISP2 were each asked of half of the sample.  HISPX combines these variables and is the full sample Hispanicity variable.
